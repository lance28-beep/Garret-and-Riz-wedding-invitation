  narratives: {
    groom: `Garret and Rizalyn's story is one of faith, patience, and divine timing. Their journey together began in ways they never expected, brought together by circumstances that could only be orchestrated by God.

What started as a friendship slowly blossomed into something deeper. Through conversations, shared moments, and countless prayers, they discovered in each other a partner who would walk alongside them in faith and love.

Garret found in Rizalyn a woman of strength, grace, and unwavering faith. Her kindness and gentle spirit drew him closer, not just to her, but to God. Through her, he learned what it means to love selflessly and to cherish every moment together.`,
    bride: `Rizalyn found in Garret a man of integrity, compassion, and steadfast devotion. His genuine heart and caring nature showed her what true partnership means. In him, she found someone who encourages her to grow, supports her dreams, and stands with her through all of life's seasons.

Together, they have learned that love is not just about grand gestures, but about choosing each other every single day, through joy and challenges alike. Their love is built on a foundation of faith, trust, and the belief that God has brought them together for a beautiful purpose.

And now, as they begin this new chapter as husband and wife, they invite you to witness and celebrate the love that God has so graciously written for them.`,
